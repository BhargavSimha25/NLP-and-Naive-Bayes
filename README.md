# NLP and Naive Bayes in Machine Learning 🧠📈

Welcome to the **NLP and Naive Bayes in Machine Learning** repository! This project provides a comprehensive introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Naive Bayes algorithm, two key components in text analysis and classification tasks. Here, you’ll find resources and examples to help you understand and apply these techniques effectively.

## 📚 Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves analyzing and processing human language to enable machines to understand and interact with text data. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, often used for text classification tasks such as spam detection and sentiment analysis.
